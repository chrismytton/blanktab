# Blanktab

A Google Chrome extension which replaces the default new tab page with a blank screen. See my blog post [Distraction-free new tab](https://www.chrismytton.uk/2018/10/14/distraction-free-new-tab/) for more details.

## Features

- Same background color as other native Chrome tabs
- Same title as the default new tab page ("New tab")

## Install

1. Download a [zip file of the latest code](https://github.com/chrismytton/blanktab/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository onto your computer somewhere.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to the extensions screen (Window &rarr; Extensions)
3. Make sure the "Developer mode" switch in the top right is turned **on**.
4. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left and navigate to the extension.

That's it! Now when you open a new tab you will see a nice, distraction-free, blank page.
